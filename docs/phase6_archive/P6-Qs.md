nderstanding & Alignment Questions

 
 ##  Scope & Approach

  2. Start with Phase A (Structure + 5 essential docs)
  continue evaluating user input, then reframe question to human
  Question: Do you want me to:

  2. DS1140_PD as Primary Example

  Question: Should I read and use the actual DS1140_PD artifacts, or would you prefer I create a simpler example (like the minimal 3-signal probe in the prompt)?

Lets discuss further 


  3. Target Audience Assumption

  The prompt targets "hardware engineers, Python developers, new forge users."

  Question: What's the priority order?
  Hopefully we can create the documentation in an order that helps introduce people to using the new forge - but ask me follow up questions 

  4. Existing Documentation to Preserve

  You need to help me evaluate each one of these files individually inside of the context of the new repo and ensure that 
  a) they are accuratelly handled in more appropriate locations 
  b) these are safe to delete
Ill give you a tip,check out @libs/* 


5. Type System Completeness
Don't get hung up on the details here just yet. 


Question: Do these slash commands actually exist in your setup? Should I try to use them, or should I write documentation manually?

They do exist, but they are intended as part of the automated code generator workflow.
